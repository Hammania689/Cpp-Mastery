Write a hash program that will find all the misspelled words in an input file called "check.txt" (you may provide your own file which includes misspelled words).  The dictionary file will be named "dictionary.txt".  Write your own hash table using linked-list-based chaining for collision handling.  Output should be misspelled words in the “check.txt” file.
