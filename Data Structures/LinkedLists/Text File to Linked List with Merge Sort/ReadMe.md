 write a linked list program that will read the names of 2 input data files from the command line (ie. list.exe inputFile1 inputFile2).  Use the nameAndAges.in and deleteThese.in files as inputFile1 and inputFile2.

The data is to consist of last name, first name, and age.

Example:              Smith Fred 36

                               White Becky 22

The data is to be placed in an ordered linked list by lastName, firstName, age.

If an incomplete record is read in (ie. no age, last name, first name) report the error and discard the input.
If a duplicate record is found (same last/first name and age), report the duplicate but DO NOT put it in the list.
If your program reads in a blank line, ignore it. DO NOT REPORT ANYTHING.
Once the sorted list is created, print it (to the screen).
The second file will contain a list of names to delete from the list (in the same format as above).

If a name to delete is not found in the list, report it (an error/missing data message) and continue.
As you delete a name, report the deletion (the name/age).
Once all deletions are completed, print out the remaining list.
Delete the list and print the list out again. (Yes, you will be printing an empty list.)
Your program must do all the above.

All output must make sense and be formatted for readability.
